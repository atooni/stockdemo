== A simple stock demo

This is a project created within a couple of hours to demonstrate how a simple REST
based service can be implemented that manages an imaginary stock of articles.

The outline of the service was specified as follows:

....
[listing]
include::src/test/scala/de/wayofquality/stockdemo/StockManagerSpec.scala[lines=9..20]
....

==== Technical Details

* The build system used for the example is SBT 1.1.1
* The technical stack for the REST service is Akka HTTP for the REST interface and an Actor bases in memory backend for the Stock Manager
* The specification above has been transformed into a specification based on ScalaTest, first for the backend and then the same test cases for the REST interface.
